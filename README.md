### My Projects
- This repository contains some of my initial projects, where I learned the fundamentals of web development.
#### What I Learned
- Setting up a project structure
- Writing basic HTML for page content
- Styling with CSS to improve appearance
- Using JavaScript for basic interactivity

These projects helped me understand the core concepts of front-end development and build a strong foundation.
